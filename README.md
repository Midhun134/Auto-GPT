## AutoGPT 
is a Rust-based project that creates automated full-stack web applications using AI agents. Here are the key components and features:
Agent-Based Architecture:
Uses multiple specialized AI agents working together:
Managing Agent (Project Manager)
Solutions Architect Agent
Backend Developer Agent
(Extensible for more agents like frontend or database agents)
Automated Development Process:
Takes a user's natural language request for a website
Converts it into a structured project plan
Automatically generates:
Backend code
API endpoints
Project scope definitions
External URL integrations
Smart Project Management:
Analyzes project requirements
Determines if CRUD operations are needed
Handles user authentication features
Manages external API integrations
Code Generation & Testing:
Generates backend code using templates
Performs automatic bug fixing
Includes unit testing capabilities
Has built-in code safety checks
Features:
Can create full-stack web applications
Handles user authentication (login/logout)
Can integrate external APIs
Creates REST API endpoints
Includes automatic error handling and bug fixing
Supports database integration
Safety & Review:
Includes safety checks before executing AI-generated code
Allows user review of generated code
Has built-in error handling and bug tracking
The project essentially automates the process of web development by using AI agents to handle different aspects of the development process, from architecture to implementation, while maintaining safety and quality checks throughout the process.
For example, if a user requests "build a fitness tracking app", the system would automatically:
Analyze the requirements
Design the architecture
Generate the necessary backend code
Create API endpoints
Handle database schema
Implement user authentication
All while allowing for human oversight and safety checks.
